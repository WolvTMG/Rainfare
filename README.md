Ensure all these dependencies are installed (Should be all built-in apart from sqlite3)

* os
* sys
* time
* random
* sqlite3

Ensure the data.db file is in the same directory as main.py

(Ignore plan.txt, it's just a text file displaying the plan for the DB)

(This is a hardcore game btw, once you die, your save gets deleted)

Enjoy!
